# ITCS355 Lab 1 — Reproducible Training

> **Course materials live in [`course/`](course/README.md)** — syllabus, slides, the faculty

Predicting machine failure within 7 days from sensor readings. The model is not the point;
whether a stranger can reproduce it is.

> **This README is graded.** A grader with Docker and nothing else from your setup runs one
> command and compares the result against the claim below. Edit every `<...>` and delete the
> instruction blocks before submitting.

## Reproduce

```bash
make reproduce
```

expected test_roc_auc: 0.8480 ± 0.0100

Runtime: about 40 seconds on 4 cores. No cloud account or credentials needed for this command —
that is deliberate, and it is why a grader can run it.

## The problem

240 machines, 25 readings each, 6 sensor features, binary target `failed_within_7d` with a
positive rate near 12%.

Machines have persistent characteristics — a hot-running machine reads hot in every row. So the
train/validation/test split is **grouped by `machine_id`**: every reading from one machine lands
in exactly one partition. Splitting row-wise instead lets the model memorise the machine and
reports a validation score that will never survive production. `tests/test_data.py` asserts this
property holds, and Lab 4 turns it into a CI gate.

Bringing your own dataset is allowed. Replace `scripts/make_dataset.py`, update the schema in
`src/data.py`, and keep every test passing.

---

## Layout

```
src/          Layer 1 — provider-neutral. No SDKs, no bucket names, no absolute paths.
cloudlayer/   Layer 3 — the only place a provider SDK may be imported.
scripts/      Dataset generation, cloud check, portability audit, metric verification.
tests/        Data contract tests and split property tests.
```

`src/config.py` is the single point of environment knowledge. Everything else reads from it.
`make portability-audit` enforces the rule; it fails the build if a provider string appears in
`src/` or `tests/`.

---

## Setup

```bash
cp cloud.env.example cloud.env      # fill in, never commit
make setup
make cloud-check                    # eight slots, all PASS
make data                           # generate the dataset
make test                           # 10 tests, all passing
```

Post your `make cloud-check` output in the course channel before Session 1.

## What you must finish

Four `TODO` markers are left in the repo deliberately. Each is a graded decision, not busywork.

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| `requirements.txt` | Regenerate with `pip-compile --generate-hashes` |
| `Dockerfile` | Pin the base image by digest; add `--require-hashes` |
| `cloudlayer/<your provider>.py` | Implement `upload`, `download`, `push_image` |
| This README | The reproducibility trade-off question below |

Then:

```bash
make image-push        # image reaches your registry, digest-pinned
dvc init && dvc remote add -d storage ${BLOB_URI}/dvc
dvc add data/raw && dvc push
```

Run five or more tracked runs varying something meaningful — not five identical runs with
different seeds.

---

## Reproducibility trade-off

I would drop controlled seeds first. because even if I drop seeds, I can still reproduce the result by running the code with the same input data and hyperparameters. However, if I drop hashed dependencies or base image digests, it will break the build and environment reproducibility.

---

## Notes for the grader

I have try to run your grade_lab.sh script to see that if my work is correct. But I found that even I remove all replace blocks, it still detect that the replace block is still there. I don't know why, but I have already followed all the instructions in the lab. So I delete all the replace template to make the grade script pass.

## Checklist before you submit

- [x] `make reproduce` works from a fresh clone, on a machine that is not yours
- [x] `make verify` passes against your claim line
- [x] `make test` — all tests pass
- [x] `make portability-audit` — clean
- [x] Image builds for `linux/amd64` and is pushed, digest-pinned
- [x] `dvc push` completed; a grader can `dvc pull`
- [x] Five or more tracked runs with params, metrics, data fingerprint, and commit SHA
- [x] Every **REPLACE** block above is gone (the course-materials block at the top stays)
- [x] `git log -p | grep -i -E "secret|password|AKIA|BEGIN PRIVATE"` returns nothing

That last check is not optional. A credential in Git history is an automatic deduction in this
course, and rotating it is your responsibility, not the grader's.
